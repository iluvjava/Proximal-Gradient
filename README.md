### **Proximal-Gradient**
The proximal gradient methods in julia. Credit to \<A Fast Iterative-Thresholding Algorithm for Linear Inverse Problem\> by Amir Beck and Marc Teboule. The implementations is based on their paper and the book by Amir \<First-Order method for Optimization\> is an essential reference for the theoretical background of this repo.
